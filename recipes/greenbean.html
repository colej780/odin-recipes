    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, this dish was at every holiday dinner my family was attending.<br>
        We might be starting new traditions, but this will always be a part of it. Even though this was<br>
        taken straight off the back of the Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup can, this is definitely my<br>
        favorite dish on this list.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (10 1/2 ounces) Campbell's Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup</li><br>
        <li>1/2 cup 2% milk</li><br>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li><br>
        <li>4 cups cooked cut green beans (french cut preferred)</li><br>
        <li>1 1/3 cups French's French Fried Onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350Â°F. Add soup, milk, soy sauce, green beans, and 2/3 cup of the onions<br><br>into a casserole dish and mix until combined well</li><br>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes or until bubbling. Stir and cover with the remaining 2/3 cup onions</li><br>
        <li>Bake another 5 minutes or until onions are golden brown. Let rest until the dish thickens</li><br>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
