    <h1>Christmas Recipes</h1>
    <p>Everybody has their own traditions for the holidays. Growing up, my family made the same food
        every year for Christmas. After college, and moving across the country, me and my partner were
        a little too far away to make it home for the holidays. Because of this, we had to start our
        own holiday traditions! Below you will find a list of everything we make for Christmas along with 
        how to actually make them.
